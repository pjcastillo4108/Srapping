Some years ago \u2014 never mind how long precisely \u2014 having little in the way of design hotels, and nothing particular to interest the restless global nomad, the insular city of Santiago quietly took to the construction of a new crop of contemporary boutique hotels. Among the first fruits of this new wave of hotel construction is Ismael 312, a nine-story contemporary boutique hotel in an easy-on-the-eye modern minimalist style, just off the Parque Forestal in Santiago\u2019s historic city center. Semi-transparent glass-walled bathrooms, flat-screen televisions, full-length windows \u2014 it\u2019s clear Ismael 312\u2019s proprietors have been paying attention to the interior-design conventions of the boutique-hotel world. This clean-lined look has quickly become the global standard, instantly rendering a million flowery bedspreads obsolete. Here, if you\u2019re fortunate, you\u2019ve got a view of the park from a private balcony; if not, you can content yourself with the pared-down simplicity of your room\u2019s contemporary design. Don\u2019t expect five-star extravagance \u2014 Ismael 312 is little more than a pied-a-terre. In this neighborhood, though, that\u2019s more than enough \u2014 you\u2019re surrounded by restaurants and picturesque old streets, not to mention the park with its selection of museums, perfectly placed to circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon."]},
